Here's how you can quickly get testing or developing against the cookbook thanks to [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/).

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
    git clone git://github.com/bflad/chef-confluence.git
    cd chef-confluence
    vagrant up BOX # BOX being centos6, centos7, ubuntu1204, ubuntu1404

You can then SSH into the running VM using the `vagrant ssh BOX` command.

The VM can easily be stopped and deleted with the `vagrant destroy` command. Please see the official [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html) for a more in depth explanation of available commands.
